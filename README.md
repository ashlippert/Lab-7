## Introduction
This repository contains documentation related to my BAE 305 Lab 7 work.

Using Git provides an efficient way to track changes in code, circuit simulations, and documentation. By maintaining a version history, I can easily revert to previous versions if mistakes occur or compare different iterations of a project.  

GitHub enhances collaboration by allowing me to share my work with lab partners, receive feedback, and contribute to shared projects without conflicts. It also acts as a cloud backup, preventing data loss and ensuring that work is accessible from any device.  

GitHub Desktop simplifies the process of managing repositories with an intuitive interface. It makes tasks like committing changes, pushing updates, and resolving merge conflicts much easier, especially for those who prefer a graphical interface over command-line operations.  

## Conclusion  
Overall, these tools make circuit lab work more organized, efficient, and collaborative.
